# DateNight ♥

A simple landing page to schedule a weekly date night ritual. Pick a day and time, and it creates a recurring 12-week Google Calendar event with curated date ideas.

## Files

- `index.html` — The landing page (no build step, just HTML/CSS/JS)
- `videos/` — Romantic background clips that cycle randomly

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Select your preferred day and time
3. Click "Make It a Ritual" to add it to Google Calendar

That's it—no dependencies, no server required.
